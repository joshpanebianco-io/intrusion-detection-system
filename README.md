# 🛡️ Lightweight Network-based Intrusion Detection System for Purple Teaming Exercise 🟣

## 📘 Overview

This project is a lightweight, custom-built network-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to run on a victim machine within a VirtualBox homelab environment. It detects network attacks launched from an attacker machine (e.g., Kali Linux) and logs suspicious activity for analysis.

This setup simulates a **purple teaming** exercise, combining offensive and defensive cybersecurity techniques to deepen understanding of network security, attack detection, and incident response.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- 🏗️ Build a simple network IDS from scratch to detect basic attacks  
- 🧠 Gain hands-on experience with networking, packet analysis, and security monitoring  
- 💻 Setup and use a VirtualBox homelab for isolated attacker and victim machines  
- ⚔️ Practice offensive tactics (attacks from Kali) and defensive tactics (IDS detection & logging)  
- 🔍 Understand how to analyze logs and tune detection rules  

## 🧪 Homelab Setup

- 🖥️ **Victim Machine:** Runs the custom IDS script monitoring network traffic and logging alerts  
- 🐉 **Attacker Machine:** Kali Linux, used to launch network attacks (e.g., ARP spoofing, port scans)  
- 📦 **VirtualBox:** Hosts both VMs with configured internal networking  

## ✨ Features

- 🕵️ Lightweight packet sniffing and anomaly detection  
- 🗃️ Logging suspicious network events with timestamps  
- 🚨 Simple alert mechanism based on custom detection logic  
- 🔧 Modular code for easy extension and tuning  

## ▶️ Usage

1. 🟢 Launch the victim machine VM and start the IDS script  
2. 🔴 Launch the Kali Linux attacker VM  
3. 💣 Execute network attacks from Kali (e.g., `arping`, `nmap`) targeting the victim  
4. 📋 Observe IDS logs for detection alerts  
5. 📈 Analyze logs and tune detection parameters  

## 📦 Prerequisites

- 🖥️ VirtualBox installed  
- 🧑‍💻 Two VMs: Victim (Linux with Python), Attacker (Kali Linux)  
- 🐍 Python 3.x installed on the victim VM  
- 📚 Required Python packages (e.g., `scapy`) installed on victim VM  

## 🧪 Example Commands

- Start IDS:  
  ```bash
  python3 lightweight_ids.py
